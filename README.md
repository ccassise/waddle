## Quick Start
```
waddle [port]
```
#### Prerequisites
- Go compiler.
- (Optional) Some program that sends data over a TCP socket. Any examples here will use `netcat` since it comes preinstalled on MacOS, most Linux distributions, and is available on Windows.

#### Build & Run
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. `cd` to its directory.
3. Compile and run with Go: `go run cmd/waddle/waddle.go [port]`. NOTE: Port is required.

This will start the server and listen on the given port.
To connect to the server:
```
nc localhost [port]
```
Where port is the same port you used on the compile and run command. You should now be able to send and receive messages to/from the server.

#### Test
```
go test ./internal/...
```
